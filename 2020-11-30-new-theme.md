title: Switching the Site Theme
---

You might have noticed that the blog looks different. I've been thinking of updating the blog for quite some time but I never really got around to it. I really wanted a dark mode layout and toggle and the theme [Chirpy]() seemed to fit all my needs. The design is minimal and focuses on functionality. I like it.

Switching themes shouldn't be hassle, and it mostly wasn't. [This answer on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/37186333/) eased the process.
