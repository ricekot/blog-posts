I am following the [Measure Theory series by D.H. Fremlin](https://www1.essex.ac.uk/maths/people/fremlin/mt.htm) and blogging my notes here.

Continuing from where I left off [last time]({% post_url 2020-07-06-measure-theory-4 %}),

#### 111X (e)
Let $X$ be a set, $\mathcal A$ a family of subsets of $X$, and $\Sigma$ the $\sigma$-algebra of subsets of $X$ generated by $\mathcal A$. Suppose that $Y$ is another set and $\phi:Y\to X$ a function. Show that $\\{\phi^{-1}[E]:E\in\Sigma\\}$ is the $\sigma$-algebra of subsets of $Y$ generated by $\\{\phi^{-1}[A]:A\in\mathcal A\\}$.

I have a confession to make. This problem had been troubling me for DAYS. It all came down to proving an equality and I was only able to prove one side of it. I eventually had to look up the solution and found one [here on StackExchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/7881/preimage-of-generated-sigma-algebra). Before I start the proof however, there is an interesting comment on the selected answer that I would like to talk about here:

[Nate Eldredge said](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/7881/preimage-of-generated-sigma-algebra#comment16942_7903),
> The general trick is that if you want to show something (call it $P$) holds for all sets $A$ in a $\sigma$-algebra $\sigma(\mathcal{C})$ generated by a known collection, the obvious approach "let $A \in \sigma(\mathcal{C})$, show $A$ satisfies $P$" is often not helpful, because you don't know what $A$ might look like.  Instead, try considering the collection $\mathcal{B}$ of all sets satisfying $P$.  If you can show that $\mathcal{B}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra containing $\mathcal{C}$, you will be done.

One question I had immediately upon reading this was: Why will we be done if we can show that $\mathcal{B}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra containing $\mathcal{C}$? Then I realised, that the $\sigma$-algebra generated by $\mathcal{C}$ is defined as the intersection of the set of all $\sigma$-algebras that contain $\mathcal{C}$, i.e.,  

$$
\sigma(\mathcal{C}) = \bigcap\{\Sigma :\Sigma\text{ is a }\sigma\text{-algebra and }\mathcal{C}\subseteq\Sigma \}
$$

which means that $\mathcal{B}$ is also a part of this intersection, and hence, every element of $\sigma(\mathcal{C})$ must satisfy $P$ because every element of $\mathcal{B}$ satisfies $P$.

I think this is a nice approach. Anyways, let's get back to the proof,

_Proof._  
We want to show that $\\{\phi^{-1}[E]:E\in\Sigma\\}$ is the $\sigma$-algebra of subsets of $Y$ generated by $\\{\phi^{-1}[A]:A\in\mathcal A\\}$. Or in other words, $\\{\phi^{-1}[E]:E\in\Sigma\\}$ equals $\bigcap T$ where 

$$
T = \{\Omega :\Omega\text{ is a }\sigma\text{-algebra of subsets of Y and }\{\phi^{-1}[A]:A\in\mathcal A\}\subseteq\Omega\}
$$

First we will show that $\bigcap T\subseteq\\{\phi^{-1}[E]:E\in\Sigma\\}$.  
- In [111X (d)]({% post_url 2020-07-06-measure-theory-4 %}) we proved that $\\{\phi^{-1}[E]:E\in\Sigma\\}$ is a $\sigma$-algebra of subsets of $Y$ (the domain of $\phi$).
- $\mathcal A\subseteq\Sigma$  
    $\implies\\{\phi^{-1}[A]:A\in\mathcal{A}\\}\subseteq\\{\phi^{-1}[E]:E\in\Sigma\\}\\}$  
    $\implies\\{\phi^{-1}[E]:E\in\Sigma\\}\in T$  
    $\implies\bigcap T\subseteq\\{\phi^{-1}[E]:E\in\Sigma\\}$

Now we will show that $\\{\phi^{-1}[E]:E\in\Sigma\\}\subseteq\bigcap T$. For this we will use the new approach we read about above. 

Let $\mathcal D$ be a family of subsets of $X$ such that for every $D$ in $\mathcal D$ we have, $\phi^{-1}[D]\in\bigcap T$, i.e.,

$$
\mathcal D = \{D: D\subseteq X \text{ and }\phi^{-1}[D]\in\bigcap T \}
$$

Now,  

(i) We know that $\emptyset\subseteq X$ and $\phi^{-1}[\emptyset]=\emptyset\in\bigcap T$. Thus, $\emptyset\in\mathcal D$.

(ii) Let $D\in\mathcal D$. For every $\phi^{-1}[D]\in\bigcap T$ we have,

$${
Y\setminus\phi^{-1}[D]\in\bigcap T \\
\implies\phi^{-1}[X\setminus D]\in\bigcap T
}$$

Also, it is obvious that $X\setminus D\subseteq X$. Thus, $X\setminus D\in\mathcal D\,\,\forall\,\,D\in\mathcal D$.

(iii) Let $\langle E_n \rangle_{n\in\Bbb N}$ be a sequence of sets in $\mathcal D$. Then $\langle\phi^{-1}[E_n]\rangle_{n\in\Bbb N}\in\bigcap T$. This means that, 

$${
\bigcup_{n\in\Bbb N}\phi^{-1}[E_n]\in\bigcap T  \\
\implies\phi^{-1}[\bigcup_{n\in\Bbb N}E_n]\in\bigcap T
}$$

Also, $\bigcup_{n\in\Bbb N}E_n\subseteq X$. Thus, $\bigcup_{n\in\Bbb N}E_n\in\mathcal D$.

From (i), (ii) and (iii) it is clear that $\mathcal D$ is a $\sigma$-algebra of subsets of $X$. 

(iv) From the definition of $T$,

$${
\{\phi^{-1}[A]:A\in\mathcal A\}\subseteq\bigcap T \\
\implies\mathcal A\subseteq\mathcal D
}$$

Thus, $D$ is a $\sigma$-algebra of subsets of $X$ that contains $\mathcal A$. This means that 

$$
\Sigma\subseteq\mathcal D
$$

and therefore from the definition of $\mathcal D$, 

$$
\phi^{-1}[E]\in\bigcap T\,\,\forall\,\, E\in\Sigma \\
\implies\{\phi^{-1}[E]: E\in\Sigma \}\subseteq\bigcap T
$$

We have thus proved both the sides, $\bigcap T\subseteq\\{\phi^{-1}[E]:E\in\Sigma\\}$ and $\\{\phi^{-1}[E]: E\in\Sigma \\}\subseteq\bigcap T$. Therefore, $\\{\phi^{-1}[E]: E\in\Sigma \\}=\bigcap T$.  $$\tag*{$\square$}$$

Phew, that was one troublesome problem. If you have reached the end of this post, I commend your willpower. Let me know if there are any mistakes in my solution, or you know of a more elegant / easier / better proof for this problem. Drop an email at ricekot [at] gmail [dot] com.
